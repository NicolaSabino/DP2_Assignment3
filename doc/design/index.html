 <h1>RnsSystem Interface Design</h1>
 <p>This design choice aims at respecting the main REST guidelines:
 	<ul>
 		<li><strong>Information hiding</strong>: The number of resources are limited only to  user available operations 
 		in order to not expose the implementation and avoid unexpected interaction with the service. For instance, a client can get a list of road segments
 		but is not able to interact with a specific road since there are no operation on this conceptual entity.
 		<li><strong>Granularity level</strong>: The whole system is well dimensioned in order to obtain a good trade off between <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>flexibility</strong> 
 		using different combination of resources.
 		For instance the user can both obtain an overall snapshot of places present in the system accessing at Places (higher workload) or can focus only on a specific category of places like Gates,
 		according to the need of the moment.
 		<li><strong>HATEOAS</strong>The service is fully navigable and self-explanatory via hyperlinks.
 	</ul>
 </p>
 <p>
 	The only available operation on <i>statics</i> resources of the systems, like places and connections, is <strong>GET</strong>.<br>
 	Creation of vehicles are performed via <strong>POST</strong> operations since we want to underline the fact that cannot be two vehicles with the same plateID in the system.
 	Furthermore a vehicle cannot enter twice in the system, must first exit and then perform a new request to enter in the system.<br>
 	Each update on the system is performed via a <strong>PUT</strong> operation since it is better than a POST for its idempotent behaviour.<br>
 	A vehicle can request to exit from the system via a <strong>DELETE</strong> operation on the corresponding <i>rns/vehicles/{id}/position</i> resource,
 	but this operation is accepted by the system only if some conditions are satisfied.<br>
 	A vehicle can be removed from the system in any moment from an administrator via a <strong>DELETE</strong> operation on the corresponding <i>rns/vehicles/{id}</i> resource and the request
 	is always accepted by the system.
